# page-align
Tool to display alignment guides over a page - best used for local page development. Note, if a site has a same-origin policy, then this tool won't be able to load the page.

Just clone the repo and open index.html to use.

The panel can be dragged anywhere in the window by clicking and dragging in the panel contents or on the drag icon in the titlebar.

The panel can be collapsed by clicking in the titlebar (anywhere but the drag icon).

Add horizontal or vertical guide lines and drag them by clicking and dragging in the yellow handles.

Change the line or handle colors for better visibility based on the background.

*Note* that the page in the background scrolls separately from your browser window.

*Also note* that if you drag too quickly in a handle or the titlebar move icon, and your cursor leaves the handle/titlebar, the line/panel will stop moving.  Simply move (while continuing to press the mouse button) the cursor back inside the handle/icon to continue moving.
