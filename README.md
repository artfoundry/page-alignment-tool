# page-align
Tool to display alignment guides over a page - best used for local page development. Note, if a site has a same-origin policy, then this tool won't be able to load the page.

Just clone the repo and open index.html to use.

To load a local file, just click the browse button and select a file.  You should be able to load any file that can be displayed in a browser window (jpg, png, gif, pdf, txt, html, etc.).

The panel can be dragged anywhere in the window by clicking and dragging in the panel contents or on the drag icon in the titlebar.

The panel can be collapsed by clicking in the titlebar (anywhere but the drag icon).

Add horizontal or vertical guide lines and drag them by clicking and dragging in the yellow handles.

Add horizontal or vertical measuring lines by clicking the button for the first one and then the button for the second one (note: don't click the button for the first veritcal measuring line after clicking the first horizontal measuring line button, and vice versa).

Change the line or handle colors for better visibility based on the background.

*Note* that the page in the background scrolls separately from your browser window.

*Also note* that if you drag too quickly in a handle or the titlebar move icon, and your cursor leaves the handle/titlebar, the line/panel will stop moving.  Simply move (while continuing to press the mouse button) the cursor back inside the handle/icon to continue moving.
